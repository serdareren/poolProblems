Pool Problems and Solves Educational Game

Pool problems is always hard to understand and I made this game for make it easier. Some examples with a clear animations, valves, pool, water and guess what is happening? Yes some valves filling the pool and some other valves pumping out and question is how much time need to full fill to pool. I simulate this problem with animations and s/he try to solve. Of course i did not forget to show the solution again with animations. I hope pools are not nightmare anymore..
used technologies: JQuery, TweenMax, HTML - CSS
